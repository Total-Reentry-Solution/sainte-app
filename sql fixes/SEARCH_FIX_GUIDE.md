# Search Functionality Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Placeholder Text**: Changed from "Try searching for a term or check back later." to "Search Name or Email"
2. **Search Functionality**: Added proper onChange handler and debugging
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Fixed search to be case-insensitive

## What I Changed

### 1. Updated Placeholder Text
- Changed the empty state message to "Search Name or Email"

### 2. Enhanced Search Functionality
- Added `onChange` handler to the search input field
- Added debugging print statements to track search behavior
- Fixed case sensitivity issues

### 3. Search Logic
- Search now works on both name and email fields
- Case-insensitive search
- Real-time filtering as you type

## How to Test

1. **Run the application**
2. **Navigate to the Citizens section**
3. **Try searching by:**
   - First name (e.g., "John")
   - Last name (e.g., "Doe")
   - Email (e.g., "john@example.com")
   - Partial matches (e.g., "jo" for John)

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Search should work in real-time as you type
- ✅ Should filter citizens by name or email
- ✅ Should be case-insensitive
- ✅ Empty state should show "Search Name or Email"
- ✅ Debug prints should show in console

## Debug Information

Check the browser console for these debug messages:
- `Search query: "your_search_term"`
- `Total citizens: X`
- `Filtered citizens: Y`

This will help verify that the search is working correctly.

**The search functionality should now work properly!**
