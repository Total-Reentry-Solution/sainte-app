## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Existing Data
- This migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid conflicts
- Existing data will be preserved
- New columns will be added to existing tables where needed

### üîê Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Case managers have appropriate permissions for their assignments

### üéØ Real-time Messaging
- The `messages` table is enabled for real-time updates
- This allows live chat functionality in your Flutter app
- No additional configuration needed

## Post-Migration Steps

### 1. Storage Bucket Setup
If you plan to use profile pictures, create a storage bucket:
- Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
- Create a new bucket called `avatars`
- Set it to public access

### 2. Test Your App
- Run your Flutter app
- Test user registration and login
- Test messaging functionality
- Verify profile picture uploads work

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check the **Logs** section for any errors
- Monitor **Database** performance metrics
- Verify RLS policies are working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Table already exists" errors
- These are normal and can be ignored
- The migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses

#### Permission errors
- Ensure you're running as a database owner
- Check that your Supabase project has the necessary extensions enabled

#### Real-time not working
- Verify the `supabase_realtime` publication exists
- Check that RLS policies allow proper access

### Getting Help
- Check the Supabase documentation
- Review the individual fix files in this directory
- Check the **Logs** section in your Supabase dashboard

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback this migration:
1. **DO NOT** drop tables with existing data
2. Instead, drop only the new tables you added
3. Use the individual fix files to selectively remove components
4. Consider backing up your database before major changes

## Next Steps

After running this migration:
1. Update your Flutter app to use the new database schema
2. Test all functionality thoroughly
3. Consider adding more specific RLS policies if needed
4. Monitor database performance and optimize as needed
