# Appointments Chart Fix

## The Issue
The dashboard was missing the appointments chart that should show appointment data over time.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Fixed AppointmentGraphComponent
- **Problem**: The component was showing "Line chart not implemented" instead of the actual chart
- **Solution**: Connected it to use the `AppointmentLineChart` component with the appointment data

### 2. Added Appointments Chart to Dashboard
- **Problem**: The appointments chart wasn't being displayed in the dashboard
- **Solution**: Added the chart to both care team and admin dashboards

## Changes Made

### 1. AppointmentGraphComponent
```dart
// Before
return Center(child: Text('Line chart not implemented'));

// After  
return AppointmentLineChart(appointmentOverTheYear: state.data);
```

### 2. Dashboard Integration
- Added "Appointments Overview" section to care team dashboard
- Added "Appointments Overview" section to admin dashboard
- Chart shows appointment data over the year (monthly breakdown)
- Proper loading and error states

## How It Works

### Chart Features
- **Line Chart**: Shows appointment trends over time
- **Monthly Data**: Displays appointments by month (Jan-Dec)
- **Interactive**: Hover effects and data points
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Data Flow
1. `AppointmentCubit` fetches appointment data
2. `AppointmentGraphComponent` processes the data
3. `AppointmentGraphCubit` converts to monthly format
4. `AppointmentLineChart` renders the visual chart

## Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ Appointments chart appears on dashboard
- ✅ Shows appointment trends over the year
- ✅ Monthly breakdown of appointments
- ✅ Interactive line chart with data points
- ✅ Proper loading and error handling

## Chart Display
The chart will show:
- **X-axis**: Months (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
- **Y-axis**: Number of appointments
- **Line**: Trend of appointments over time
- **Dots**: Individual data points for each month

**The appointments chart should now be visible and functional on the dashboard!**
